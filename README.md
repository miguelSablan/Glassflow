# Glassflow

A simple browser extension that removes that annoying Glassdoor login/signup overlay so I can browse the site in peace.

### How to load the extension in your browser:
1. Download the project.
2. Go to the Chrome extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the Glassflow folder.
5. The extension should now be loaded and functional. Test it out by searching for a company's page on Glassdoor.
